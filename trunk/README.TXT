1. What is PPLib?

   PPLib (or PPL) stands for "Patrick's Programming Library" and is a
   collection of functions and classes for C++ applications, written by
   Patrick Fedick. It covers file and directory functions, strings and
   arrays, time, math, threads, graphics, sound, database access and
   internet communication.

   You can find the newest version and documentation of this library under

       http://www.pfp.de/pplib

2. Installation

2.1 UNIX
    The UNIX version comes with a standard configure-script. In most
    cases it is sufficient to simply do

        ./configure
        make
        make install    (do this as root)

    The configure script tries to find out on what system the library
    should be compiled and what optional libraries are available of
    which PPLib can make use of (e.g. graphic libraries or databases).

    If it does not find a library of which you know that it is
    installed somewhere, you can manually set a search path for it
    during configure, e.g.:

        ./configure --with-mysql=/usr/local/mysql

    If you don't want a specific library compiled in, you can deselect
    it with "--without-xxx', where xxx stands for the library. Example:

        ./configure --without-mysql

    Please see "./configure --help" for a list of all available
    options.

2.2 Windows
    PPLib comes with project files for Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003,
    but you have to do some manual configuration to adapt it to your
    system.

   For more details and examples about installation, please read the HTML
   documentation.

3. Usage

   How to use the functions and classes if PPLib is described in the
